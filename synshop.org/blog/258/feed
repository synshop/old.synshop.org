Hence: the audio-switchbox. See the youtubevideo below for a quick overview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoklbNUIXEo&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoklbNUIXEo&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Faux Stained Glass Spiderman art</title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pvUOC0y-8Ro/Uc_haixzmQI/AAAAAAAAGVg/bITMGA4fcDY/s1024/Picture%2014.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;612&quot; height=&quot;329&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my first project made entirely at Synshop. After seeing something online a few months ago where someone had created a stained glass image of Iron Man on an antique window.  and was inspired. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I looked around first, and couldn&#039;t find any antique windows that were big enough for me. So I resolved to create a frame that would hold glass I sourced myself. I had never done  framing of this sort before so I had to kind of figure things out as I went along. Complicating the build was the fact that I picked up a suggestion from a fellow Synner to have two panes of glass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Cu_2VbVWRJk/Uc_hddcU5jI/AAAAAAAAGV8/8Lr9ZdBGjFY/s912/Picture%25206.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;456&quot; height=&quot;340&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used the  table router to cut the grooves. The glass turned out to .1/5 inches thick, meaning it was too small for a  1/4 inch router bit, but too big forn a 1/8 inch router bit. So routing it out required a 1/8 inch bit, and offsetting the wood just enough to meet the 1/5 of an inch necessary to secure the glass with no rattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once the frame was assembled I painted it black. I then moved on to painting the glass.  Faux stained glass is placed on a pane of glass in two phases. The first phase is to create the fake leading, which creates a boundary for the stain that comes later: and replicates the metal  that holds real stained glass together. The fake leading is applied a lot like puffy fabric paint. The Second phase is smelly lacquer that gets applied with eye droppers. &lt;br /&gt;Source for the paints and leading is: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jurgeninc.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://jurgeninc.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I applied it ion two panes - The first pane replicates the New York Skyline. and sits behind the second pane, which has the Spiderman bust and decorative webbing pieces. I printed the Images I made into line-art on to multiple sheets of 11x17paper: having to  tape them together to form the entire eimage.  I then applied the fake leading. Below you can see the fake leading applied on the second pane, with the first pane completely finished and drying in the background. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-531UVwsnEyM/Uc_hgipT6tI/AAAAAAAAGWU/ukUgp26Fh0U/s720/Picture%25208.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;279&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right at the end of the build, a fellow Synner suggested that I add Lighting to the project specifically  LED Strip lighting. on the inside to back-light the Spiderman bust. I concurred, and set about sourcing and implementing this. I soldered two lengths of LED Light strip in parallel,  running up the sides of the build, with a power cable sticking out through the bottom, I left a female barrel connector on, in case I wanted to run it on battery, or swap it back to the power plug. the lights run on 9volt, so I dont need any special batteries to run the lights. &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kbGxr_4yh24/Uc_hYbDu4aI/AAAAAAAAGVM/Oi_78bJ6uqM/s720/Picture%252010.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;270&quot; height=&quot;370&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that all that needed doing was painting the front pane of glass, and buttoning it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-e1MUKCVSr8o/Uc_haKlwf3I/AAAAAAAAGVc/7UiWqeIXGds/s912/Picture%252013.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;456&quot; height=&quot;340&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1tc8SXEaups/Uc_hdDC_fjI/AAAAAAAAGV4/NVwRfGHT_9o/s912/Picture%252016.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

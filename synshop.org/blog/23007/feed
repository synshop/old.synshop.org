 <title>Lockpicking</title>
 <link>https://synshop.org/blog/cybersorcerer/lockpicking</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heading to the shop today to start recording some lockpicking videos for my YouTube channel and to promote lockpicking night at the shop on Mondays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also going to record a hackerspace tour video of the whole shop. Las Vegas is known for DEFCon and Blackhat but I don&#039;t see too many SynShop&#039;s videos on YouTube like other hackerspaces. So hopefully I can help do some promotion of the shop on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Discord Chat</title>
 <link>https://synshop.org/blog/cybersorcerer/discord-chat</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well after getting my membership to SynShop, I got onto the shops Discord channel to hang out and get to know a few people. It has been pretty exciting. At least when everyone&#039;s chatting...LOL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granted, being self-employeed I don&#039;t just hangout waiting for someone to say something either. So if you want to get someone&#039;s attention you hace to address then by there name in the chat. Just prefix the name with &#039;@&#039; and it will let them know someone&#039;s addressing them. Naturally most people reading this here would know that so maybe I should make this post on my own blog...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, was going to try and get down to the shop for the first time tonight but things came up, as usual, and I didn&#039;t make it. So I AM going to set aside time for this Friday&#039;s security meet. Maybe I can get down their Wed or Thu too. We&#039;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

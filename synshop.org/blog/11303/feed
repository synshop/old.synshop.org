 <title>laser cutting and etching lines do not align </title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;When using the laser cutter last night i found for some reason even though the lines were aligned on my file to the extent at wich i could align them with the inkscape program they seemed even more off when cutting. This might be due to the cutting width or it might need to be compensated by aligning the stroke to the inside of the path. Other than that the test runs for my portfolio went well so hopefully there is a solution. I have not found one online that deals with such a thing yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

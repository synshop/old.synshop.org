# old.synshop.org
Archival copy of synshop.org which was active from May 2012 - Sep 2023

## What?

In 2023 we redid synshop.org to no long be based on Drupal, and instead be [statically hosted](https://github.com/synshop/synshop.org).  This copy of the site was made with [httrack](https://github.com/xroche/httrack).

## First post

NB - mentions of "wiki" server have been moved to [RFTM](https://rtfm.synshop.org/)

> We've just pulled the trigger on migrating to the new server for the SYN Shop site.  We have a snazzy new Drupal based front end, that James has put a lot of work into getting up and running.  He's done a great job in getting things working before he and Rebecca head off for their wedding/honeymoon.

> The wiki has been moved from http://synshop.org/wiki to https://wiki.synshop.org.  Also in the process of moving the wiki, it's been upgraded to the latest and greatest in TikiWiki, with a new look at that.  Something you'll also notice is that everything uses SSL by default now.  We'll also be picking up a wildcard certificate for the *.synshop.org subdomains, which gives us the ability to run SSL on any other servers we decide to stand up.

> Last and certainly not least, Suz has assured us that she has a great new look for the site.  She's not there yet, but we're eager to see the new design as soon as she's ready.  So you'll likely see further changes on the site in the near future.
